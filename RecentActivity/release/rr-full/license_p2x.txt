LICENSE AGREEMENT
You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using this software. Unless you have a different license agreement signed by IndigoSTAR Software, your use of this software indicates your acceptance of this license agreement and warranty.

Registered Version

Each registered copy of Perl2Exe may be used at a single workstation to create an unlimited number of exe files, subject to the following conditions:

* A separate registered copy of Perl2Exe must be obtained for each workstation on which Perl2Exe will be used even if such use is only temporary. This is not a "concurrent use" license.

* Exe files created by Perl2Exe are shipped with Run-time portions of Perl2Exe. No registered user, nor anyone else, may alter or modify the generated Exe files. You cannot give anyone else permission to modify the Exe files.

* Exe files generated by the registered version of Perl2exe may be freely distributed.

All rights not expressly granted in this license agreement are reserved entirely to IndigoSTAR Software

Governing Law

This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada.
